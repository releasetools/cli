# Release tools for bash workflows

This toolkit represents a collection of bash scripts for various purposes.

> Any and all contributions are welcome; just open a PR.

## Quickstart

1\. Install the tools

```shell
# curl
bash <(curl -sSL "https://github.com/releasetools/cli/releases/download/v0.0.11/install.sh")

# or wget
bash <(wget -q -O- "https://github.com/releasetools/cli/releases/download/v0.0.11/install.sh")
```

Or alternatively, with `brew`:

```shell
brew tap releasetools/tap
brew install rt
```

The tools will by default be installed to `~/.local/share/releasetools/cli/VERSION/` and a binary will be symlinked at `~/.local/bin/rt`.

2\. Utilize the _releasetools_ library

```shell
# With ~/.local/bin in your PATH:
export PATH=~/.local/bin:"$PATH"

# You can run commands, e.g.:
rt base::::version
# vX.Y.Z

# Optionally, check that all dependencies for all modules are correctly installed
rt base::check_deps
# Ok.

# You can also check the install location
rt base::install_location
# /Users/user/.local/share/releasetools/cli/vX.Y.Z/releasetools.bash
```

### Customizations

Several customizations can be applied prior to installation:

1\. The location where the tools will be installed:

```shell
export RELEASETOOLS_INSTALL_DIR="$HOME/.local/share"
# proceed with the installation steps outlined above
```

2\. The path where the binary is symlinked:

```shell
export RELEASETOOLS_BINARY_DIR="$HOME/.local/bin"
# proceed with the installation steps outlined above
```

## GitHub Action

The `releasetools/cli` library can be installed via a GitHub workflow:

```yaml
steps:
  ...
  - uses: releasetools/cli@v0
  ...
```

A few customizations are available, if needed:

```yaml
steps:
  # Install releasetools
  - uses: releasetools/cli@v0

  # Customizations
  # with:
  #   # Pin a specific version (defaults to latest)
  #   version: "v0.0.11"
  # env:
  #   # Configure the installation directory
  #   RELEASETOOLS_INSTALL_DIR: /home/runner/.local/share
  #   # Configure where binaries are linked (e.g. a directory that is already in PATH)
  #   RELEASETOOLS_BINARY_DIR: /home/runner/.local/bin

  # Check that `releasetools` was installed correctly
  - run: rt base::check_deps
```

> **NOTE:** Release tools uses `python` for certain actions. When installed as part of a workflow,
> it will attempt to install the [required dependencies](/requirements.txt), if `pip` is available in the `PATH`.

If the workflow also needs python, it is recommended to install it before releasetools, e.g.:

```yaml
steps:
  # Install Python first, to avoid having to install dependencies separately
  - uses: actions/setup-python@v6
    with:
      python-version: "..."

  # Will install releasetools and necessary python dependencies
  - uses: releasetools/cli@v0
```

## Developers
